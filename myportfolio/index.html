                <p>The purpose of this website is to help you get to know me a little better. Here I will present about my professional experiences, the projects that I worked on professionally, as well as personal projects that I carried out or that are in development. I will also present about my qualifications, the things I have studied and am currently studying. I'll talk about what I know how to do and which areas I want to evolve in the future. Finally, to get to know me better, I'll tell you a little about my hobbies and other relevant activities.</p>
                <h4>My professional experiences</h4>
                <p>Hello, my name is Airon, I'm 31 years old and I currently work as a Software Developer at Avenue Code. I work as an application developer for the Android operating system, working with native development in Kotlin. Previously, I worked at Zarp System and Nexaas. In both companies I also worked as a native developer for Android programming with Kotlin. I started working with software development in 2020. Before that date, I worked for almost 5 years in the field of Industrial Automation, Robotics and Machine Vision System.</p>
                <h4>My academic qualifications</h4>
                <p>I am graduated as Control and Automation Engineer. I am pursuing my second BA in Software Development at Brigham Young University Idaho. I also have an Associate Degree in Applied Technology and two Certificates in Database and Computer Programming.</p>
                <h4>My hobbies and extracurricular activities</h4>
                <p>I am married and have a 2 year old son. I love spending time with my family. I like to play with my son and take him for walks in children's playgrounds, squares, circus, etc. We also like to travel and spend time with my parents and in-laws. Personally, I like technology, I like learning new things, I like music and watching movies and series.</p>
